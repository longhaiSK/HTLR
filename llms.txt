## HTLR: Bayesian Logistic Regression with Heavy-tailed Priors

*HTLR* performs classification and feature selection by fitting Bayesian
polychotomous (multiclass, multinomial) logistic regression models based
on heavy-tailed priors with small degree freedom. This package is
suitable for classification with high-dimensional features, such as gene
expression profiles. Heavy-tailed priors can impose stronger shrinkage
(compared to Guassian and Laplace priors) to the coefficients associated
with a large number of useless features, but still allow coefficients of
a small number of useful features to stand out with little punishment.
Heavy-tailed priors can also automatically make selection within a large
number of correlated features. The posterior of coefficients and
hyperparameters is sampled with resitricted Gibbs sampling for
leveraging high-dimensionality and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling
high-correlations among coefficients.

## Installation

[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) version (recommended):

``` r
install.packages("HTLR")
```

Development version on [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("longhaiSK/HTLR")
```

This package uses library [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/) for
carrying out most of matrix operations, you may get speed benefits from
using an alternative BLAS library such as
[ATLAS](https://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/),
[OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/) or Intel MKL. Check out this

for the comparison and the installation guide.
