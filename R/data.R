#' Colon Tissues
#'
#' In this dataset, expression levels of 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissues 
#' for 6500 human genes are measured using the Affymetrix technology. 
#' A selection of 2000 genes with highest minimal intensity across the samples
#' has been made by Alon et al. (1999). The data is preprocessed by carrying out 
#' a base 10 logarithmic transformation and standardizing each tissue sample to 
#' zero mean and unit variance across the genes.

#' Pima Indians Diabetes
#'
#' This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
#' The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, 
#' based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed 
#' on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are 
#' females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Different from the UCI original version, 
#' the dataset has been preprocessed such that rows with missing values are removed, and features are scaled.
