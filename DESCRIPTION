Description: Efficient Bayesian multinomial logistic regression based on heavy-tailed 
  priors. The posterior of coefficients and hyper-parameters is sampled with restricted 
  Gibbs sampling for leveraging high-dimensionality and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for 
  handling high-correlations among coefficients, Li and Yao (2018) <arXiv:1405.3319>.
