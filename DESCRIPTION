Description: This package performs classification and feature selection by 
  fitting Bayesian polychotomous (multiclass) logistic regression models based on 
  heavy-tailed priors with small degree freedom. The software is suitable for 
  classification with high-dimensional features, such as gene expression profiles. 
  Heavy-tailed priors can impose stronger shrinkage (compared to Guassian and Laplace priors) 
  to the coefficients associated with a large number of useless features, 
  but still allow coefficients of a small number of useful features to stand out 
  without punishment. Heavy-tailed priors can also automatically make selection within 
  a large number of correlated features. The posterior of coefficients and hyperparameters 
  is sampled with resitricted Gibbs sampling for leveraging high-dimensionality and 
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling high-correlations among coefficients. 
  The core computation in this software is carried out with fast C++ code.
