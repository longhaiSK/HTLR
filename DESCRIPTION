Description: This software performs classification and feature selection by fitting Baeysian polychotomous 
  (multiclass, multinomial) logistic regression models based on heavy-tailed priors with small degree freedom. 
  This package is suitable for classification with high-dimensional features, such as gene expression profiles. 
  Heavy-tailed priors can impose stronger shrinkage (compared to Guassian and Laplace priors) to the 
  coefficients associated with a large number of useless features, but still allow coefficients of a 
  small number of useful features to stand out without punishment. It can also automatically make selection 
  within a large number of correlated features. The posterior of coefficients and hyperparameters is sampled 
  with resitricted Gibbs sampling for leveraging high-dimensionality and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling 
  high-correlations among coefficients.
