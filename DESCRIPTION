Description: Efficient Bayesian multinomial logistic regression based on heavy-tailed
  (hyper-LASSO, non-convex) priors. The posterior of coefficients and hyper-parameters
  is sampled with restricted Gibbs sampling for leveraging the high-dimensionality and
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling the high-correlation among coefficients. A detailed
  description of the method: Li and Yao (2018), 
  Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 88:14, 2827-2851, <arXiv:1405.3319>.
