Description: Efficient Bayesian multinomial logistic regression based on heavy-tailed 
  priors. This package is suitable for classification and feature selection with high-dimensional 
  features, such as gene expression profiles. Heavy-tailed priors can impose stronger 
  shrinkage (compared to Gaussian and Laplace priors) to the coefficients associated with 
  a large number of useless features, but still allow coefficients of a small number of 
  useful features to stand out without punishment. It can also automatically make selection 
  within a large number of correlated features. The posterior of coefficients and hyper-
  parameters is sampled with restricted Gibbs sampling for leveraging high-dimensionality 
  and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling high-correlations among coefficients.
