Description: This package performs classification and feature selection by fitting Baeysian polychotomous (multiclass) logistic regression models based on heavy-tailed priors with small degree freedom. The software is suitable for classification with high-dimensional features, such as gene expression profiles. Heavy-tailed priors can impose stronger shrinkage (compared to Guassian and Laplace priors) to the coefficients associated with a large number of useless features,  but still allow coefficients of a small number of useful features to stand out without punishment. Heavy-tailed priors can also automatically make selection within a large number of correlated features. The posterior of coefficients and hyperparameters is sampled with resitricted Gibbs sampling for leveraging high-dimensionality and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling high-correlations among coefficients. The core computation in this software is carried out with fast C code.
