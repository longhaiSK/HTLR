This package performs classification and feature selection by 
fitting Bayesian polychotomous (multiclass) logistic regression models based on 
heavy-tailed priors with small degree freedom. The software is suitable for 
classification with high-dimensional features, such as gene expression profiles. 
Heavy-tailed priors can impose stronger shrinkage (compared to Guassian and Laplace priors) 
to the coefficients associated with a large number of useless features, 
but still allow coefficients of a small number of useful features to stand out 
without punishment. Heavy-tailed priors can also automatically make selection within 
a large number of correlated features. The posterior of coefficients and hyperparameters 
is sampled with resitricted Gibbs sampling for leveraging high-dimensionality and 
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling high-correlations among coefficients. 
The core computation in this software is carried out with fast C++ code. 

## Installation

~~You can install the released version of HTLR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:~~

``` r
install.packages("HTLR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("longhaiSK/HTLR")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(HTLR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
