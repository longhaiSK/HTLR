\description{
In this dataset, expression levels of 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissues 
for 6500 human genes are measured using the Affymetrix technology. 
A selection of 2000 genes with highest minimal intensity across the samples
has been made by Alon et al. (1999). The data is preprocessed by carrying out 
a base 10 logarithmic transformation and standardizing each tissue sample to 
zero mean and unit variance across the genes.
